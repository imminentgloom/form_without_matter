# (readme not updated for 2.0)

Form, without matter. A drum-sequencer for monome norns and grid.

Supports N.B. et al.

Four tracks. 96 ppqn. Full access to every substep. Edit steps in time on the grid or program each substep as desired. Play unquantized. Multiple flavours of entropy on tap. Audio-rate fills. Can genereate a large amount of notes rapidly. Adjust speed limit to achieve desired level of downstream stability. 

*form!matter strives to be entropically inclusive.*  

2.0 rewrite, added modules for sanity. pattern management on grid, patterns are persistent, edit note/vel/dur
1.2 adds a first pass at note selection, which complicates the interface a bit, and improves interface drawing.
